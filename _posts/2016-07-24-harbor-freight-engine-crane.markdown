I did quite a bit of research on engine cranes and the one from Harbor Freight made the most sense for me.  I got the 2-ton to provide more flexibility in terms of reach.  Naturally, Harbor Freight was having a sale, so I was able to get 20% off.  

The box was heavily damaged, but all the parts and pieces were intact.  I appreciated that all the assembly hardware was labeled on carbard in plastic shrink wrap (I was certain that a bolt fell out through the damage box).  The assembly was easy enough.  I didn't realize that the wheels were different sizes but that was easy to fix later.  

Some of the reviews stated that the engine crane might slowly go down if you leave the engine hanging on it over night. That happened to mine as well, but I was prepared and placed the engine on the ground.  I noticed the engine had rolled slightly the next morning and there was more slack in the chains.
