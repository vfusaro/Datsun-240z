excerpt: It's too slow.  Surely, it can go faster.

This knockoff Power Wheels car had problems from the day we got it.  It was shipped already assembled thrown in a box.  The plastic tires were cracked, the steering wheel was cracked, the seams didn't line up.  It looked like the car was previously used.  We ended up getting our money back and kept the car.  

When the plastic wheel finally cracked the car became lumpy to drive.  That's when I thought, it should be possible to modify this by adding rubber tires and make it go faster.  I had just taken the [engine out of the Z]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-01-240z-removing-engine-and-transmission %}), so I thought this would be a quick fun project.    

I did some research and purchased two more powerful electric motors, two 12V/12A SLA batteries (wired in series for 24V/12A), and front and rear go kart wheels.  The plan was to paint it blue but my daughter saw pink berry at the store, and so it became pink.

It took some time (months) to make all the parts fit together, but I was pleased with the results.  On the first test drive the car launched with an ear piercing whine and proceeded to strip the plastic gears in the gearbox within 30 seconds...thus launching a year long process to find some way to make it work ([see Part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-09-electric-car-mod-part2 %})).
