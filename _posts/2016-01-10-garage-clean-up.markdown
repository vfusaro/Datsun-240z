excerpt: The goal is to still have a functional garage for 2+ cars

Before I could get a project car, I needed to make room in the 3-car garage.  Like most people in California, we were using the third car garage for storage, and it was pretty much a disaster.  The entire garage needed to be reorganized and optimized for storage.  I also wanted to be able to park both daily drivers in the garage.  This meant that the third garage could no longer be used for storage.  

We sold some things, donated others, tossed more, and eventually paired it down to a reasonable amount of "stuff" we can't live without.  The garage walls are about 9 feet high with more space in the rafters.  I wanted to take advantage of the vertical space as much as possible (yep, that's a Christmas tree up there).

The shelves are 8x8x2 (WxHxD) feet on the 2-car garage and 10x7x2 (WxHxD) on the single car side.  I modified the [plans](http://diydoneright.com/projects/garage-organization/) from Simpson's site.  It was pretty straightforward and cost a fraction of the steel shelves I was considering from [Uline](http://www.uline.com/BL_3943/Bulk-Storage-Racks).

The plan is to put the project car in the middle of the garage (space 2) and park our daily drivers on either side.  For complicated repair work, I can pull out both cars and have the full garage.

This will be a work in progress as I figure out exactly what tools and how much space I will really need.  For now, both working cars fit comfortably in the garage and there's room for a project car.
