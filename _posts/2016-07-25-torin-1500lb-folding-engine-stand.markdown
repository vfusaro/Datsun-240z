excerpt: 1500 lbs capacity should hold the engine - right?
---

The main concern with the engine stand was to find one with 4 or 5 wheels for stability and one that would fit between the legs of the engine crane.  I went with the Torin 1500 lbs folding engine stand.  One of the end caps was cracked and I'm too lazy to call. Assembly was easy.
