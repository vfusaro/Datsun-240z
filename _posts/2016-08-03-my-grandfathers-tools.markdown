My dad drove my grandfather's toolbox and various assorted tools from FL to CA for me.  We wouldn't have been able to get the engine out without these tools.  He had a set of engine chains, which obviously came in handy, as did the longest screwdriver in the world (~3 feet long).  We estimate the Snap-on toolbox is about 50 years old - it would make for another fun restoring project at some point.  

It's like he's here helping me restore the car.
