excerpt: I wanted to find a good starter project car that I would enjoy driving and be fun to keep around

To be honest the Datsun wasn't at the top my list.  I wanted an old Aston Martin DB5 (like Bond) or maybe and early 70's Porsche 911, but ultimately they were too expensive and probably not the best choice for someone with no experience.  I started researching mid to late 60's Camaro SS and Z28, Ford Mustang, Corvette, or Austin Healey.  There was an outside hope for a Shelby GT500.  

Knowing my personality, if I wasn't interested in the car then I wouldn't put the time and attention into restoring, and I would lose sight of the ultimate goal - driving!  I needed to find a car with some history and that would capture my interest.  I started watching [Wheeler Dealer](http://wheelerdealers.discoveryuk.com/car/datsun-240z/) and saw the show with the 240Z.  After that I was hooked!

I focused all my effort on learning more about Datsun and the 240Z from when [Yutaka Katayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutaka_Katayama) first brough to the US to the impressive racing heritage with Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) to the way that it changed American culture by making sport cars affordable while offering better performance than Jaguar, BMW, and Porsche.  When Yutaka katayama died in 2015, Car and Driver produced a good article, ["Yutaka Katayama, “Father of the Datsun Z,” Dead at 105"](http://blog.caranddriver.com/yutaka-katayama-father-of-the-datsun-z-dead-at-105/), with more background information about Mr. Katayama's role in bringing the Datsun to the forefront of sportscars.  It also includes links to a 3-part tribute produced by Nissan.  

This is the car I am going to restore!
