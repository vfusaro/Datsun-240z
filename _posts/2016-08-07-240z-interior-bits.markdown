This car originally had red interior, but was converted to tan at some point.  The seats appear to be in good condition.  The door cards probably need to be replaced due to "upgraded" speakers that were mounted in the doors.  The center console, seat belts/buckles, handles, window cranks all appear to be in good condition and will benefit from a thorough cleaning.
