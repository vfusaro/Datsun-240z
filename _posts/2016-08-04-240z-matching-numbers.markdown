excerpt: This is what matching numbers mean

The car number (or VIN) is HLS30-64860.  This is consistent with the identification plate in the engine bay, the stamped VIN on the firewall, and the manufacturer plate on the driver door.  Curiously, the dashboard VIN number is missing.  Unfortunately, the engine block and head are not original.  The engine number on the identification plate is L24-081193 but the actual engine number is L24-330128.  The original engine head was likely an E88 but is actually an N47.  According to the documentation from the original owner the engine was replaced on Jan. 16, 1992 and had approximately 60,000 miles.  In retrospect, I should have passed on this car given that the engine is not original.
