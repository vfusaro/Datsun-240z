The car number (or VIN) is HLS30-64860 on the identification plate and what is stamped on the firewall in the engine bay.  Curiously, the dashboard VIN number is missing.  Unfortunately, the engine block and head are not original.  The engine number on the identification plate is L24-081193 and the actual engine number is L24-330128.  The original engine head was likely an E88 but is actually N47.  According to the documentation from the original owner the engine was replaced on Jan. 16, 1992 and had approximately 60,000 miles.
