excerpt: Why is this so hard?

This is the continuation of [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-03-electric-car-mod-part1 %}).  After stripping the plastic gears, I spent a great deal of time trying to find a metal gear that was compatible with the gear box.  I wasn't able to find anything remotely close to working after calling fabrication shops and scouring the Internet in the US and China.  This is because the car is not a true Power Wheels so the common parts didn't fit.

At some point, I came across a Razor Drifter Go Kart and found an electric motor for that - but it was chain driven.  I found a compatible sprocket to mount on the drive wheel and then it was just a matter of installing the motor in a reasonable place on the car to make it all work.  

The positioning was difficult because the plastic flexed under load and that caused the chain to slip off.  I tried all kind of different strategies to keep the chain on, but in the end I decided to fabricate a chain guard to keep it on the sprocket.  I also build a metal box under the back end of the car and mounted the motor to that so the entire thing was more rigid.  Finally, this seemed to work and my daughter was able to successfully drive it.  I estimate it goes 10-12 mph and I really need to run after her to keep up.

It turns out with the power the motor requires and the way it's currently wired it only has one speed - fast.  No reverse and no slow speed.  Also, the Razor motor doesn't brake like the DC motors, so it doesn't stop.  There might be a Part 3 to this saga.
