Removing the gas tank was challenging without a helper.  I needed to support the gas tank with a floor jack in order to losen all the tubes and strapping.  After draining any remaining fuel and briefly cleaning it, I sealed all the openings with duct tape to keep out dirt and bugs.  Not shown is the reservior tank, which is used to relieve expansion and bubbles due to heating.
