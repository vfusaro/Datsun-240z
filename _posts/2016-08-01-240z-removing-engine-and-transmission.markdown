Removing the engine and transmission was one of the first steps in "How to Restore Your Datsun Z-car".  It took a bit of doing to disconnect everything from the engine and label things.  It helped that I already removed the radiator and fan.  My dad was in town so together we decided to go for it - in the end it wasn't that hard.  It turned out to be harder to find the right bolts to mount the engine to the stand because the stores were sold out.  Fastenal had them M10x1.5x90 (x4) plus some washers.

I wasn't sure if the built-in engine slingers (hooks) would be sturdy enough to support the engine, so that's why in some pictures the chain is wrapped around the engine - the thought being it would still support the engine in case the hook pulled off.  This turned out not to be such a great idea because we couldn't get the engine at the right angle to pull out.  The hooks were fine.  We needed to add more slack in rear chain in order to angle the engine enough so it would not hit frame on the way out.  This took a little bit of trial and error.  When I do this again, I'd bring the engine crane down as close to the engine as possible to reduce the chain length.  This will help reduce the height necessary to lift the engine out.  Part way out we relized we needed to close the garage to allow for the extra height.

The transmission came out after removing two bolts.  We supported the transmission with a jack to keep it level while we positioned the engine crane.  

The car needed to be on jackstands in order to position the engine crane under the car.  This also gave the transmission room to drop as the engine was angled out.
