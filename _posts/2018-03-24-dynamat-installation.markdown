excerpt: The Internet says I want this

Honestly, I was on the fence about using sound deadening material because it's not original to the car and I want to hear, smell, and feel the heat of the car just like in 1972.  However, there were a number of little holes in the floor pan and this material will add protection (I'm also going to get that fixed from the underside when I take the car back to the body shop).  Also, the Internet highly recommends some type of sound deadening material to make driving more pleasant.  Just check out this [review from Road and Track](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a10348895/what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-a-1970-1973-datsun-240z/):

"If you find yourself with the interior out of a Z car, do yourself a favor and load up the inside of any accessible panels with sound deadening such as Dynamat—it makes a huge difference in minimizing the “tinny” sound of the Z’s unibody, especially when you shut the long, resonant doors."

Based on my research Dynamat is the clear leader, if you don't mind spending the extra money.  I ordered two boxes of Dynamat Xtreme (36 sq ft each).  That should cover the interior cabin and doors.  Not surprising, it doesn't sound as "tinny" anymore.
