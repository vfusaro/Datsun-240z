excerpt: It's back and it's silver!

After nearly four months, the Z is back.  I took it semi-local place called [Images Auto Body](http://imagesautobody.com/) based on a recommendation from a guy at Cars and Coffee who used them to restored his classic Jag.  Turns out the owner started out working on Datsuns and thought this would be a fun project.  

They had the car bead blasted to bring it down to bare metal and that's when we saw evidence of previous body work with lots of bondo.  The guys had to do a lot of extra work to get the lines straight and the seams even.  They used Glasurit paint to match the original 901 silver paint code.  They even left the frame on a rolling dolly, which makes it very easy to move around the garage.

While the work is clearly high quality, there are some obvious issues.  The biggest one are the chisel marks and holes on the drive floor pan.  I'm not sure why they let that leave the shop.  There are some other paint blemishes.  When I called about all of this they said they would address it when I bring the car back.  They also had a number of office staff leave and that made communication more difficult.  

Still...it's so nice to look at.
