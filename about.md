I'm a software engineer during the day, but I wanted to find something else to do at nights and on the weekend...and apparently "work" doesn't count.  So, I thought it would be fun to have a hobby...like restoring a classic car.  After all my grandfather was a mechanic, my dad worked a bit on cars, I have a mechanical engineering degree (and a PhD), I read a few articles...

How hard can it be?
